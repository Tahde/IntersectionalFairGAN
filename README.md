# IntersectionalFairGAN

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of IntersectionalFairGAN, a tool aimed at addressing fairness in machine learning models with intersectional group considerations. The project includes models, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks for processing and visualizing results from the Adult dataset.

## Folder Structure
- `IntersectionTabFair/`: Contains the main scripts, models, and data for analyzing intersectional fairness.
  - `Adult_logs_VIZ.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for visualizing logs and running analyses.
  - `logs.log`: Log file generated by the process.
  - Other files related to training and testing models.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tahde/IntersectionalFairGAN.git
